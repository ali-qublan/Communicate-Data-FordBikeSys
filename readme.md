### Dataset Overview
This data set includes information about individual rides in 2017 made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.

The above mentioned Data Set focuses on information with regard to the individual rides undertaken in a bike-sharing system expanded over the greater San Francisco Bay Area.
